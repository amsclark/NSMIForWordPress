Importing NSMI Categories into Wordpress is Easy!

Step 1: On your WordPress site, install and activate the BulkPress plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulkpress/

Step 2: On your Wordpress site, install and activate Category Tag Pages plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/category-tag-pages/ 

Step 3: In the sidebar at the left, click on BulkPress, and then click on Terms under the Bulkpress menu.

Step 4: Copy the contents of the text file in this repo into BulkPress. Make sure the Taxonomy dropdown says Category and the Add to Parent Category says "No Parent". Also make sure the box for "Create inexistent parent terms" is checked, and click the Add Terms button.

Hint: I recommend adding them about 500 at a time instead of all 1938 at once as it seems to use a lot of server resources.
